# Satellite Jamming Simulator

This is (yet another) fork of the excellent [Satellite Tracker](https://github.com/dsuarezv/satellite-tracker) project by David Suarez.

This included some fixes and extensions made to suit my needs and bring the project back to working status.

It adds the ability to simulate basic Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) scenarios for satellites in Earth Orbit. It is intended to help users gain a simple intuition of the interaction between orbital motion and radio transmission requirements.

The underlying model is a simple calculation of Free Space Path Loss on the basis of distance between two isotropic antennas: one aboard the spacecraft and the other located on the Earth's surface. Both the jammer and defender are assumed to be operating in the same frequency and no protocol-level implementation is simulated.

Orbits are propagated using recent data from the Celestrak satellite catalog and the SGP4 implementation from [satellite-js](https://github.com/shashwatak/satellite-js) library.

Feel free to modify this for your own learning and projects. Some things you might find fun to try implementing:
* Jamming from one ground-station to another with the satellite as the primary transmitter (e.g. GPS jamming)
* ~~Jamming from one satellite to another~~ (acomplished with adjustable height)
* Jamming in near-band frequencies
* The presence of multiple jammers or transmitters

## Running the App
This is a static client-side javascript implementation. Running it should just be a matter of:
```bash
cd spacejam-demo/
npm install
npm run start
```

This has been tested with `node v18.4.0`, your mileage may vary with other versions.

(Also worth noting that you need `python` and Visual Studio C+ workload installed for `node-gyp` to work properly)

## Making Modifications
Most of the relevant physical modeling implementation is contained in `engine.js` or `tle.js`. Most of the UI is implemented directly in `App.js`.
